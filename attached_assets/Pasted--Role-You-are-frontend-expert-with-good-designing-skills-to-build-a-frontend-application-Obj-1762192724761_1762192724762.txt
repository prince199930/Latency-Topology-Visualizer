#**Role:**
You are frontend expert with good designing skills to build a frontend application
#**Objective:**
Create a Next.js application that displays a 3D world map visualizing exchange server locations and real-time/historical latency data across AWS, GCP, and Azure co-location regions for cryptocurrency trading infrastructure.
#**Instructions:**
1. Create a Next.js project if you don't already have one set up.
2. Use a 3D mapping library (e.g., Three.js, Mapbox GL JS, or similar) for creating the 3D world map visualization.
3. Implement real-time latency monitoring using any open API that provides network latency data (e.g., Cloudflare Radar, Pingdom, or similar). Ensure the service is unpaid/free for demo purposes.

Functional Requirements
1. 3D World Map Display
• Render an interactive 3D world map.
• Display exchange server locations as 3D markers on the map.
• Allow users to rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D map for exploration.
• Implement smooth camera controls and transitions.

2. Exchange Server Locations
• Plot major cryptocurrency exchange server locations (e.g., OKX, Deribit, Bybit, Binance, etc.).
• Display server information on hover/click (exchange name, location, cloud provider).
• Use different visual markers or colors to distinguish between AWS, GCP, and Azure hosted servers.
• Show a legend explaining the marker types and colors.

3. Real-time Latency Visualization
• Create animated latency connections between exchange servers and cloud regions.
• Display real-time latency values as animated data streams or pulse effects.
• Update latency data at regular intervals (e.g., every 5-10 seconds).
• Use color-coded connections to represent latency ranges (green for low, yellow for medium, red for high).

4. Historical Latency Trends
• Implement a time-series chart showing historical latency data for selected server pairs.
• Allow users to select specific exchange pairs or regions to view historical trends.
• Display latency statistics (min, max, average) for the selected time period.
• Include time range selectors (1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days).

5. Cloud Provider Regions
• Visualize AWS, GCP, and Azure co-location regions on the 3D map.
• Show region boundaries or clusters with distinct visual styling.
• Display region information including provider name, region code, and server count.
• Implement filtering options to show/hide specific cloud providers.

6. Interactive Controls
• Add a control panel for filtering by exchange, cloud provider, or latency range.
• Implement search functionality to quickly locate specific exchanges or regions.
• Add toggle switches for different visualization layers (real-time, historical, regions).
• Include performance metrics dashboard showing current system status.

7. Responsive Design
• Ensure the application is responsive and user-friendly across various screen sizes.
• Optimize 3D rendering performance for mobile devices.
• Implement touch controls for mobile interaction with the 3D map.
#**Notes:**
Technical Requirements
• Use TypeScript for type safety and better code organization.
• Implement proper error handling and loading states.
• Optimize 3D rendering performance.
• Use modern React patterns (hooks, context, etc.) for state management.
• Implement proper data caching and state management for real-time updates.

Evaluation Criteria
• Code quality and organization
• 3D visualization implementation and performance
• Real-time data integration and updates
• User interface design and interactivity
• Responsive design and mobile optimization
• Bonus features implementation (if any)
• Performance optimization and best practices
